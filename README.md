# What is it?
This project is the API of my PeTi-React project. You can find it here https://github.com/aloisio-costa/PeTi-react-.net

### What did I use?
- Entity Framework Core
- Swagger
- SQL server
- Postman for testing

#
The project is still in development, I make changes frequently as I can or as I evolve as a developer and 
learn new things I can implement in it.

### Note:
- This project needs a lot of  improvements, I made it as simple as possible to have something work with my client side
